This is a very simple parameterization implement.
The input is a 2-manifold and a quad file(*.quad).
The quad file format is as follow:

line 1: the number of conner vertex (n)
the next n lines: each conner vertex's index in mesh

line n+2: the number of quad path (m)
then is each path's vertex number and its vertics
